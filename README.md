Are you already used to AI giving hardware advice with great confidence while clearly not understanding hardware at all?

If you are tired of suggestions like "just make the ground trace wider" or "place the capacitor anywhere first and tune it later", this repository is built for you.

`hardware-agency-agents` is an open-source library of hardware engineering skills organized by real engineering roles. Each skill document focuses on a specific role boundary, technical constraints, workflows, communication style, and expected deliverables, so hardware tasks can be approached with more rigorous engineering judgment instead of generic assistant-style advice.

This repository is inspired by the organizational clarity of strong skill libraries, and it maintains English engineering roles alongside historical translation resources, with a focus on board-level constraints and production-oriented design thinking.

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository and inspect the available engineering roles:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yniantongtian-oss/hardware-agency-agents.git
   cd hardware-agency-agents
   ```

   Select the relevant English-language role file from the directory index.
   For a client-specific installer, inspect `install.sh` before running it.

2. Pick the closest skill for your task from the index below.
3. Read that skill as the primary engineering role.
4. Add one or two adjacent skills when the task crosses domains.
5. Use the skill content to frame review comments, design constraints, debug hypotheses, and validation plans.

Suggested starting points:

- Board implementation: `PCB Hardware Engineer`
- STM32 boards: `STM32 Hardware Engineer`
- Power design: `Power Hardware Engineer`
- EMC and corrective action: `EMC Hardware Engineer`
- Validation closure: `Hardware Validation Engineer`
- Hardware design review: choose the matching review skill from `hardware-design-review-validation/en/` before board release, EVT/DVT issue closure, or production introduction

## 📢 Public Notes

- This repository is a collection of hardware skill documents, not an official built-in library for any single agent platform
- The content is intended for role selection, design discussion, review guidance, and engineering analysis, not as an automatic guarantee of project correctness
- Users should still validate all conclusions against datasheets, standards, measurements, and project-specific constraints
- This repository is not officially affiliated with ST, TI, NXP, ADI, Altium, KiCad, or other vendors and platforms mentioned in hardware workflows

## 📦 Overview

- 47 hardware role skills plus 8 hardware design review skills, each in English and Chinese (110 documents)
- 8 engineering domains
- Coverage across PCB implementation, embedded hardware, power, EMC/compliance, validation, SoC/FPGA platforms, and communication interfaces
- Suitable for schematic review, PCB constraint analysis, hardware design review, debug work, validation planning, and production-readiness discussions

## 🧭 How To Use

You can treat each `.md` file in this repository as a reusable specialist role template:

1. When the task boundary is clear, choose the most relevant skill as the primary role.
2. When the problem crosses domains, choose one primary skill and add one or two closely related supporting skills.
3. When the task is in review, validation, debug, or production handoff stages, prefer skills that emphasize constraints, verification, and deliverables instead of pure functional discussion.

Typical examples:

- STM32 control board schematic review: start with `STM32 Hardware Engineer`, optionally add `PCB Hardware Engineer` and `EMC Hardware Engineer`
- Buck converter stability and thermal analysis: start with `Power Hardware Engineer`
- High-speed board layout and impedance constraints: start with `High-Speed PCB Engineer` or `SI/PI Engineer`
- EVT/DVT validation closure: start with `Hardware Validation Engineer` or `EVT/DVT Engineer`
- Hardware design review before board release or production introduction: start with the matching skill in `hardware-design-review-validation/en/`

If your task is mainly about the following areas, start here:

- Schematic-to-board implementation: `PCB Hardware Engineer`, `PCB Layout Engineer`, `High-Speed PCB Engineer`
- Control boards and embedded platforms: `MCU Hardware Engineer`, `STM32 Hardware Engineer`, `Embedded Systems Hardware Engineer`
- Precision analog and signal-chain work: `Analog Hardware Engineer`, `Signal Chain Hardware Engineer`, `Mixed-Signal Hardware Engineer`
- Power, storage, and drives: `Power Hardware Engineer`, `Power Electronics Engineer`, `Motor Drive Hardware Engineer`, `BMS Hardware Engineer`
- Compliance, reliability, and corrective work: `EMC Hardware Engineer`, `Safety Compliance Engineer`, `Hardware Reliability Engineer`, `Certification Engineer (CE FCC UL and More)`
- Debug and validation closure: `Board-Level Debug Engineer`, `Hardware Test Engineer`, `Hardware Validation Engineer`, `EVT/DVT Engineer`
- Board-release, design-review, EVT/DVT issue-closure, and production-introduction reviews: use the matching `Hardware Design Review and Validation` skill

## ✨ What Makes This Repository Different

- It is organized by real hardware roles rather than by abstract knowledge topics
- It emphasizes engineering rules, constraints, verification logic, and deliverables instead of glossary-style descriptions
- It covers a full lifecycle from design and review to debug, validation, and production handoff
- It can be used both as an agent role library and as an internal capability map for hardware teams

## ⚖️ License

This repository is released under the [MIT License](./LICENSE). You may copy, modify, distribute, and use it commercially, as long as the original copyright and license notice are preserved.

## 🤝 Contributing

If you want to add skills, expand domains, refine role boundaries, or improve repository structure, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

Before submitting changes, keep these standards in mind:

- Skill names should be clear and role boundaries should be explicit
- Frontmatter should include at least `name` and `description`
- Content should emphasize constraints, workflows, deliverables, and application scope
- Do not submit internal company materials, customer-sensitive content, or copyrighted assets you do not own

## ✅ GitHub Checks

GitHub Actions is configured to validate this repository on pull requests and manual runs:

- skill frontmatter completeness
- duplicate `name` values
- whether local skill links in `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` point to real files

These workflows are only for repository quality checks. They do not automatically install skills into any local agent directory.
## 🚀 Possible Next Steps

If you continue expanding this repository, these are strong next improvements:

- add a consistent naming and tagging system across domains
- add cross-skill composition suggestions such as `STM32 + EMC + Validation`
- keep the English and Chinese indexes synchronized
- clarify primary vs secondary roles where skill boundaries overlap
